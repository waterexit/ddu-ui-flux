This plugin is a UI implementation for ddu.
This UI displays item names scrolling from right to left, similar to an airport electronic bulletin board. You can change the displayed item by executing the 'next' action or 'prev' action. Additionally, it is possible to configure the 'next' action to execute automatically at regular intervals.

Currently, only Neovim is supported.
